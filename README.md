# computus-in-sed

The sed script for performing the calculation of the date of Eastern Orthodox Easter (using
the Gregorian calendar).

For more details see the actual implementation in `computus.sed`.

TODO: In principle, it is possible and not so hard to implement other
algorithms for computus (e.g. for Catolic Easter).
